# Staff_Student_Management_API


The **Staff_Student_Management_API** is a robust backend system designed to manage staff and student data efficiently. Built using **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **Sequelize**, this project supports role-based authentication using **JWT tokens**, ensuring secure access and operations.

<br><br>

## 📄 API Documentation


All API endpoints, sample responses, and test cases are documented in Postman:

## 👥 Roles


There are three types of users:

- **Admin** – Full access to all routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Staff** – Can only access **GET** routes.
- **Student** – Can only access **GET** routes.


<br>

## 🔐 Authentication


- All roles require authentication using **JWT tokens**.
- On successful login, a **JWT token** is returned.
- Include the token in the headers as:  
  `Authorization: <your_token_here>`


<br>

## 🚪 Login Endpoints


- **Staff Login** – `POST /staff/stafflogin`
- **Student Login** – `POST /student/studentlogin`

Each returns a JWT token upon valid credentials.
